# Area-Calculator

### Hey guys! Josh here.

This is just a small program I made that calculates the area of something based on the height and width.
It is simple to use, just type in the Width and Height of your thing (e.g. shape) and it will
calculate the area.

## Requirements

1. You must download the latest version of Python 3 so you can open the file, [download it here.](https://www.google.com).
2. You must have access to the console/terminal (depending on your operating system).
3. You must have git installed on your device.

## How to install

To download, open your console/terminal and cd into a folder that you want to download it in. Example:

```
$ cd Desktop
```
```
$ cd example-folder
```
Then, you must type the following code:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Binancil/Area-Calculator
```
If you get an error, then you may need to install git. Do a quick google search to figure out how.

If done correctly, a folder should appear inside the folder you picked.
